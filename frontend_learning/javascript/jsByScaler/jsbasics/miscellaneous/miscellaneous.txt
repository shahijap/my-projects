Miscellaneous Topics:
1. Truthy and falsy values
2. Primitive and Reference Data Types
3. Deep copy and shallow copy
4. Closures
5. Currying
6. Null vs undefined vs Not defined
7. type of Operator and Array.isArray method

a. primitive and Reference data types:
    1. numbers, strings, null, boolean, undefined --> all comes primitive bcz these are immutable and these are created in stack memory(values of varibles are fixed)
    2. objects, arrays, functions --> all comes under reference bcz these are mutable and these are created in heap memory
        in reference datatypes both(stack and heap memories are allocated) here varible values stored as a poniter locating obj in heap memory.
