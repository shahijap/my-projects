What are Arrays?
1. Similar to a variable an array also stores data but it can store multiple data items.
2. It enables storing multiple values under a same variable name and we can also perform operations on them by using different methods and properties aslo every value gets a sequential index starting from 0.
3. In javascript arrays can store values of different data types whereas in statically typed language arrays will store only that data by which the array is defined.

Representing an Array?
Array starts from index 0 by default and it goes upto the last element.
