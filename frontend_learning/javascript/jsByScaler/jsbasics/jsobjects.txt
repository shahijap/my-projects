Introduction to javascript objects?
1. In javascript, an object is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Each key-value pairs is called a property.
2. The key of a property can be a string. And the value of property can be any value, e.g.,a string, a number, an array, and even a function.
3. Javascript provides you with many ways to create an object. The most commonly used one is to use the object literal notation.

Initializing an object with object literal notation:
1. Every other object in javascript describes a different entity with its properties.

e.g., var person = {
    firstName: 'shahija',
    lastName: 'patnam',
    age: 40
};
