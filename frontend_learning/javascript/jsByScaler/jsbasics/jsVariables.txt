Variables  in Javascript?
1. Variables are containers for storing data/storing data values.
2. Variable means anything that can vary. In javascript, a Variable stores the data value that can be changed later on.
The var keyword:
1. There is a reserved keyword in javascript which is used to declare variables that is the 'var' keyword.
2. We can store any datatype in a Variable.

Dynamically vs statically typed languages:
1. statically typed languages: each Variable and expression is already known at compile time.
2. Dynamically type languages: Variables can receive different value at run time and their type is defined at run time.

Examples:

1. It is a statically typed(java, c++) java code where we define datatypes to a Variable  before executing code to run time.
2. before run time type checking is done.

class Scaler {
    public static void main(string[] args){
        int var = 10;
        char letter = 'q';
        string s1 = 'java';
        Boolean isAvailable = true;
    }
}

1. Type checking is done in run time.

var a = 10;
var greet = 'Hello';

Rules to declare a variable:
1. All javascript variables must be identified with unique names.
2. These unique names are called identifiers.
3. identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names(age, sum)
4. The general rules for constructing names for variables(unique identifiers) are:
    1. Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
    2. Names must begin with a letter.
    3. Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial).
    4. Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
    5. Reserved words (like javascript keywords) cannot be used as names.
