What is synchronous and asynchronous programming?
1. Synchronous programming means it will use a single-threaded, so only one operation or program will run at a time
2. Sync is blocking - it will only send the server one request at a time and will wait for that request to be answered by the server.
3. Asynchronous is non-blocking, which means it will send multiple requests to a server at a time.
4. Async increases throughput because multiple operations can run at the same time.
5. In a single thread: (synchronous)
    1. fn(10s)
    2. fn(15s)
    3. fn(5s)
    overall it takes to execute the function is 30s.
6. In a multi thread: (asynchronous)
    1. fn(10s)
    2. fn(15s)
    3. fn(5s)
    all functions execute parallelly and over all time it takes is 15s which is the max time taken by function in the thread.
7. asynchronous more faster compare to synchronous in terms of performance.

Topics:
1. What is Async programming
2. Callbacks (setTimeout, setInterval etc)
3. callback queue and event loop
4. Promises
5. async/await
6. microtask queue
7. Sequential and Parallel execution of code.

a. async javascript:
    1. call stack, node api, eventloop, call back queue all together will give async behaviour inside javascript.

b. promises:
    1. pending 
    2. fulfilled -> get resolved promise with then method 
    3. rejected -> get rejected promise with catch method 
    4. settled
c. micro task queue order:
    1. promises
    2. callbacks
    3. microtask queue have high priority than task queue
