What are functions?
1. A function is block of code that performs a specific task.
2. A javascript function is executed when "something" invokes it(calls it). 
3. Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in javascript.
4. A function in javascript is similar to a procedure -- a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.

Declaring and invoking a function:

function demo() {
    console.log('hello');
}  --> declaring a function
demo()  --> invoking or calling a function

Parameters and Arguments:

1. A function can be defined with a set of parameters that it will take.
2. parameters are generally the values that we want the function to accept.
3. Arguments are the values that we pass for those parameters.

function add(a, b){   // a, b are parameters
    console.log(a + b);
}
add(2, 3) // arguments
