1. Once node js is installed go to the respective folder and give --> npm init (it creates package data)

2. It asks for metadata: 
   package name(folder name ex. node), 
   version(1.0.0),
   description, 
   entry point (index.js is entry point for the application)

3. To create a server:
   var http = require('http');
   http.createServer(function(req, res) {
      res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
      res.end('Hello world')
   }).listen(8080);

4. To read a file:
   var fs = require('fs');
   fs.readFile(fileName, function(err, data){
      res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
      res.write(data);
      return res.end();
   }).listen(8080);

5. url Parsing:
   var addr = 'http://localhost:8080/urlparsing.html?name=shahija';
   var result = url.parse(addr);
   result.hostName -> gives localhost:8080
   result.pathName -> gives /urlparsing.html
   result.search -> gives ?name=shahija (parameter)

6. NPM(Node Package Manager):
   1.using npm we install various packages to extend functionality
   2.using express we can able to implement api functionality in a server.
   3.api is an interface, which allows you to accept requests and based on the requests it process the requests and give response back.
   4. Four main requests are:
      1.GET -> GET request is made to retreive data from the server.
      2.POST -> POST request is made to save the data into the server for further use.
      3.PUT -> PUT request is made to update the data into a server.
      4.DELETE -> DELETE request is made to delete data from a server.
7. Express is a framework that allows you to implement api functionality. 
8. with the npm i express command it creates package lock.json and node modules and all dependencies.
9. Sending data into request using path variables(path varaibles data send to endpoint to use and process the request).
10. node-persist package allows for persistent storage of node data.
